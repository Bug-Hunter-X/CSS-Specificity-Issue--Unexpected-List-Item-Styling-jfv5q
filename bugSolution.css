To fix this, check for more specific CSS rules that may be overriding your `ul li` selector.  For instance, rules like `#myUL li` (targeting a specific `<ul>` with the ID `myUL`) or `.special-li` (targeting `<li>` elements with that specific class) take precedence.  Consider if you really need this level of specificity. If you do, refactor so the rules do not conflict.  It is also possible there is a hidden parent class or id that applies only to the first list item. Make sure your cascading is correct.

Here's a possible solution which would ensure all items are styled blue:

```css
ul li {
  color: blue;
}
/*Add any other styles here*/
```

This improved version directly sets the color to blue in a way that takes precedence over other conflicting styles.
